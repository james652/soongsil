The model resumed from 'checkpoints_base_bn' at epoch 40 with an initial error of 0.1243. The test accuracy (Acc@1) decreased from 87.6% to 63.3% after the adversarial trigger was applied, indicating a significant drop in performance. The test error increased from 0.1243 to 0.3666 after the trigger, with an error delta of 0.1600."

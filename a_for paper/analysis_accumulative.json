        "answer": "Verdict: High-confidence ongoing accumulative poisoning with trigger-induced collapse.\n\nEvidence from logs\n- Attack config present: attack_method=pgd, epsilon=0.2 (≈51/255), use_advtrigger=True, poison_scale=1.0, num_steps=2, threshold=0.6. These are explicit attack flags.\n- Baseline (resumed): Acc@1=0.864, error=0.1360, loss=0.4436.\n- Accumulative collapse (pre-trigger, 4 online epochs):\n  - Acc drops: 0.864 → 0.793 → 0.670 → 0.478 → 0.388 (−0.476 absolute; −55.1% relative). Avg −11.9 pp/epoch; largest single-epoch drop −19.2 pp (epoch1→2).\n  - Error rises: 0.1360 → 0.6117 (+0.4757 absolute; 4.50×).\n  - Loss explodes: 0.4436 → 3.7881 (8.54×).\n- Threshold breach: error 0.6117 > 0.6 at epoch 3. Time-to-threshold = 3 epochs. Error slope to threshold ≈ +0.1586/epoch.\n- Trigger effect:\n  - Before trigger: error=0.6117 (acc=0.3883), loss=3.7881.\n  - After trigger: error=0.7449 (acc=0.2551), loss=8.3447.\n  - Delta (after−before): error +0.1332; accuracy −13.32 pp; loss ×2.20.\n\nComparison to literature (CIFAR-10, online, Table 1 in KB)\n- Worst reported poisoned-trigger accuracy drop: −11.99±1.27 pp at ε=0.1 with optimizing P + momentum.\n- Observed post-trigger drop: −13.32 pp at ε=0.2, exceeding the paper’s worst mean by ~1.33 pp and within the direction expected for stronger ε.\n\nCollapse/attack indicators (quantified)\n- Monotonic accuracy degradation across epochs with large steps (−7.1, −12.3, −19.2, −9.0 pp).\n- Error crosses configured threshold (0.6) at epoch 3.\n- Loss escalation by 8.54× pre-trigger and additional 2.20× under trigger.\n- Post-trigger accuracy drop (−13.32 pp) consistent with targeted trigger activation and larger ε.\n\nConclusion\n- Attack confirmed by config and behavior. Severe accumulative degradation (−47.6 pp pre-trigger) and significant trigger-induced collapse (−13.32 pp) indicate model failure progression. Immediate rollback to pre-attack checkpoint (epoch40) and disabling adv trigger recommended.",

        "text": "Determination: Accumulative Attack (PGD-based online accumulative poisoning with adversarial trigger). Rationale: The run is executed via the accumulative attack training script with explicit adversarial configuration (attack_method=pgd, Linf ε=0.2, num_steps=2, use_advtrigger=True). Starting from a clean checkpoint (Acc@1 86.4%, error 13.6%, loss 0.444), online training rapidly collapses performance across four epochs: error 20.71% -> 61.17% (+40.46 pp), accuracy 79.29% -> 38.83% (−40.46 pp), and loss 1.097 -> 3.788. The configured failure threshold (0.6) is breached at epoch 3. Subsequent adversarial trigger evaluation drives a further targeted failure: error 61.17% -> 74.49% (+13.32 pp), accuracy 38.83% -> 25.51% (−13.32 pp), and loss roughly doubles (3.788 -> 8.345). These are definitive signatures of an Accumulative Attack with an adversarial trigger, not Brainwash or Label Flipping. Confidence: high. Immediate actions: halt online training; revert to the pre-attack checkpoint; disable use_advtrigger and any poisoning routines; enforce safe loading with torch.load(..., weights_only=True); audit the online data/optimizer pipeline; and deploy monitoring gates for per-epoch error/loss spikes and post-trigger deltas.",

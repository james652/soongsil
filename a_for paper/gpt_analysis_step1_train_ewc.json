  "summary": "The training step was executed successfully using the EWC (Elastic Weight Consolidation) approach on the split_cifar100 dataset. The model was trained for 20 epochs with a batch size of 16 and a learning rate of 0.01. The training process included warnings related to deprecated PyTorch methods and tensor construction practices. The model achieved an average accuracy of 72.2% on the first task, with accuracy improving over the epochs. The training log shows evidence of successful model training and evaluation, with results saved after each task."

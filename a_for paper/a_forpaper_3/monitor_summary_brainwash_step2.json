Justification: The optimization behavior during Task 8 is consistent with clean EWC training—per-component losses increase briefly at task start then converge back to the same low levels observed at the end of Task 7, with no persistent instability or degradation. The extremely large, unlogged portion of the total loss appears to be a stable regularization term (e.g., EWC penalty) present across tasks rather than an attack effect. There is no evidence of the hallmark drops in BWT or last-task accuracy required to attribute Brainwash, nor patterns indicative of Accumulative Attack (progressive cross-task degradation) or Label Flipping (sustained high task loss).

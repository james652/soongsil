The step executed a BrainWash routine explicitly (--mode='reckless') and exhibited hallmark symptoms: an early catastrophic loss spike with a negligible stability penalty (loss_bn share ≈ 8.8e−5), followed by convergence to a low-accuracy plateau. The last-task accuracy collapsed to 36.0%, which is a −32.3 point deviation from clean EWC (68.3%) and even worse than reported BrainWash baselines (51.0–58.8%). Training stagnated over the final epochs (acc_target −0.4 pts; mean_traj_loss nearly constant), and current-task accuracy hovered near 15%, indicating poisoned optimization rather than normal EWC behavior. While BWT cannot be computed without per-task accuracies, the command-line configuration and the severe last-task crash decisively confirm a Brainwash attack at this stage.",

Rationale: The training trace during 단계 2/4 includes explicit image-space poison regularizers (tv_loss, norm_loss) with smooth, monotonic decreases alongside task_loss and loss_bn, matching BrainWash-style poison optimization reported in the KB for CIFAR-100/EWC. There is no evidence of runtime collapse; instead, logs indicate a successful poison crafting phase. Given the clean baseline in 단계 1/4 and the strong alignment of observed objectives with BrainWash mechanics (as opposed to label flipping or benign noise), the most likely scenario is a BrainWash attack being executed in this step. Immediate next action: compute post-T BWT and last-task accuracy to confirm the expected BrainWash deltas (alarm if BWT ≤ −10 or last-task accuracy ≤ 55%).",

          "Knowledge base: On CIFAR-100 with EWC, BrainWash at ε≈0.1 drives BWT down by ~4–8 points and last-task accuracy down by ~10–17 pp, far beyond uniform noise controls; this pattern discriminates targeted poisoning from benign perturbations.",

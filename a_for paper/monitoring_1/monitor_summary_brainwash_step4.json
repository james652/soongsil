BWT collapsed from −1.74 pp (pre-attack) to −47.86 pp (Δ −46.12 pp), old-task accuracies average 10.02%, overall average 13.6%, and last-task accuracy remains moderate at 46.0%. The per-task forgetting profile (−39 to −61 pp across tasks 1–9) aligns with BrainWash objectives and is far worse than clean or uniform-noise baselines. This decisively confirms a successful BrainWash poisoning, with severity exceeding typical published “reckless” settings (warn: over-poisoning).
